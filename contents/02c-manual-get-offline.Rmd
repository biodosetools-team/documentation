## On RStudio {#manual-get-offline}

Many laboratories will prefer to use their own computers to run the app instead of relying on an external server, either for security reasons or better reliability.

To run Biodose Tools on your local machine, you need to install R [@R-base]. Additionally, we recommend to install RStudio [@R-Rstudio].


### Installing R


#### Under Windows {-}

Versions of R for Windows XP and later, including 64-bit versions, are available at CRAN. The distribution includes `Rgui.exe`, which launches a self-contained windowing system that includes a command-line interface, `Rterm.exe` for a command-line interface only, Rscript.exe for batch processing only, and `R.exe`, which is suitable for batch or command-line use. 

More information on Windows-specific issues can be found in the [CRAN R for Windows FAQ](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html).


#### Under macOS {-}

A version of R for macOS 10.6 and higher is available at CRAN. This is distributed as a disk image containing the installer. In addition to the graphical interface version, a command line version (particularly useful for batch operations) can be run as the command `R`. 

More information on Macintosh-specific issues can be found in the [CRAN R for Mac OS X FAQ](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html).


#### Under GNU/Linux {-}

R is available for most Linux distributions through your distribution's repositories. For example, R is provided on Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu by the `r-base` package. Many additional packages, such as `r-cran-rpart`, are provided at the maintainer's discretion. 

To install R on Ubuntu, run the following commands on the Terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

To install R on Fedora, run the following command on the Terminal:
```bash
dnf --refresh install R
```

To install R on Arch Linux, run the following command on the Terminal:
```bash
sudo pacman -S r
```

### Installing RStudio

RStudio for Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux can be downloaded from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). RStudio requires R to be installed on the local machine, so make sure to install it first.

Once installation is complete, the recommended next step for a new user would be to start RStudio and run a sample session.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/user-manual/rstudio-mac.png", dpi = 96)
```

The `>` character is the command prompt, and commands are executed once the user
presses the RETURN or ENTER key.

### Installing Biodose Tools

*During the beta testing phase, Biodose Tools will not be available as an R package.*

The application can be easily installed by runnning
```r
install.packages("BiodoseTools")
```

Alternatively, if you want to download the development version, you can just run
```r
devtools::install_github("biodosimetry-uab/biodose-tools-package")
```

### Running Biodose Tools

Once it is installed, Biodose Tools can be easily run by typing
```r
BiodoseTools::runApp()
```
