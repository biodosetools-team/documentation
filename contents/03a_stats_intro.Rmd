# (PART) Statistical Methods {-}

# Introduction {#stats-intro}
This chapter presents a review of the existing statistical methods for the different implemented modules, i.e., 
 
- Dicentric analysis.
- Translocation analysis.
- Micronuclei analysis (*work in progress*).

The primary objective of this section is to provide biologists with technical information about the statistical methods and tests used on Biodose Tools. The main source is [@IAEA2001] and the papers the statistical analyses are based on.
