## Biological dosimetry {#intro-biodosimetry}

Biological dosimetry aims estimating the absorbed dose in an individual in which an exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is suspected, by means of analysing biomarkers of dose [@IAEA2011]. A great majority of biomarkers of dose exposition are those coming of the induced DNA damage, most of them analysed using cytogenetic techniques such as dicentric chromosomes, translocations or micronuclei. Dose-assessment is based in converting an observed yield of damage (i.e., the frequency of dicentrics present in peripheral blood lymphocytes) in an absorbed dose using a pre-established calibration curve. This process assumes mathematical models and statistical probability distributions. First, to elaborate a calibration curve blood samples must be uniformly irradiated at several doses, and the observed aberration cell distribution is confronted generally to a Poisson distribution. It is assumed that for low-LET radiation types uniform exposures result in a dicentric cell distribution that agrees with Poisson [@Edwards1979]. High-LET radiation types tend to show overdispersed distributions. Then the observed yields at different doses are used to construct a calibration curve assuming a Linear-Quadratic model or Linear, depending on the radiation quality. High-LET radiation types tend to be linear [@Edwards1980]. The coefficients of these models are obtained using maximum likelihood or iteratively reweighted least squares approaches.

In case of an accident the observed cell distribution of aberrations is confronted to the Poisson distribution to distinguish between homogeneous exposures from heterogeneous ones. If homogeneous exposure is accepted. To estimate a dose and its uncertainty, the observed yield is interpolated to the curve and uncertainties are usually calculated considering only the uncertainty relative to the yield observed or considering also uncertainties coming from the calibration curve [@Edwards1978; @Merkle1983; @Savage2000]. Procedures to consider both sources of uncertainties are not simple because mixes confidence intervals coming from Poisson distribution, and confidence intervals from the normal distribution from the LQ or L models of the calibration [@Merkle1983; @Savage2000]. If heterogeneous exposures is determined, other approaches are then applied [@Dolphin1969; @Sasaki1968; @Pujol2016]. Bayesian methods have been recently proposed to consider both sources of uncertainty, and for both, whole- and partial body dose assessment [@Ainsbury2014; @Morina2015; @Higueras2015].
