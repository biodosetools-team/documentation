# Background and goals {#intro-background}

Over the years more powerful software has been developed to aid biologists in their daily work. Biodose Tools is the next step.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/chronology.svg")
```

## R Shiny as a statistical tool {#intro-background-rlang}

### R

R is a general purpose package that includes support for a wide variety of modern
statistical and graphical methods (many of which have been contributed by users). It is available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The R Foundation for Statistical Computing holds and administers the copyright of the R software and documentation. R is available under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form.

### R Shiny 

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R, combining the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web.

- Access to a powerful web framework for building web applications using R.
- Being in complete control of the mathematics and statistics behind.

- Rethink what biologists and laboratories need in their everyday workflow.
- Build a complete, fully documented tool.
- Provide an Open Source tool to the community.

### Modules {#intro-background-modules}

Different modules can be built for each function (fitting, dose estimation, …) while being totally independent from one another.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '35%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stats/iaea-cover.jpg", dpi = 2)
```

This opens up the possibility to implement statistical methods not included in the IAEA Manual (2011).
