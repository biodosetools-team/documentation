## User interface {#manual-use-ui}

We describe the user interface (UI) components in this section.

### Design principles 



Color is an effective, powerful and instantly recognizable medium for visual communications. In Biodose Tools color is used to identify different sections of information, a technique called *color-coding*.

> Once users are attuned to the color schemes, they can use them. Even before then, they'll know when they've left one section for another, if they notice that the color scheme changed. So color-coding works to distinguish one section from another; it makes the boundaries clear.
