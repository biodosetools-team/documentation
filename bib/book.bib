abstract = {A dose-effect curve obtained by analysis of dicentric chromosomes after irradiation of peripheral blood samples, from one donor, at 11 different doses of $\gamma$-rays is presented. For the elaboration of this curve, more than 18 000 first division metaphases have been analyzed. The results fit very well to the linear-quadratic model. To validate the curve, samples from six individuals (three controls and three occupationally exposed persons) were irradiated at 2 Gy. The results obtained, when compared with the curve, showed that in all cases the 95% confidence interval included the 2 Gy dose, with estimated dose ranges from 1.82 to 2.19 Gy. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Edwards1979,
abstract = {Data on the distribution of dicentrics and acentrics observed when human lymphocytes are cultured for 48 h after irradiation by X-rays, gamma-rays, and neutrons are presented. Analysis shows that for dicentrics, the observed distribution for X-rays, gamma-rays, and fission neutrons may be described by Poisson statistics but for higher energy neutrons overdispersion is observed. The phenomenon of overdispersion is also observed for acentrics irrespective of the radiation used. The possibility that overdispersion results from the variations of dose in sensitive sites leads to the conclusion that for dicentrics the site size is considerably larger than the 1--2 micrometer diameter derived by applying the dual action theory to the dose effect relationships. This larger site may well be the cell nucleus.},

@article{Savage1966,
abstract = {The distribution between cells of radiation induced chromosome exchange aberrations in a number of species conforms to the terms of a binomial [p + (1 - p)]n. The current explanation for this observation is that there are only a few places (termed "sites") within the nucleus, where the participating chromosomal threads come close enough together for exchange to take place. p is taken as representing the probability of obtaining an exchange in a site, and n the number of "sites" in the cell available for exchange. Mathematical consideration is given to the case where not all cells in the population have the same number of "sites", and it is concluded that n is a distribution parameter indicating the way in which cells with different numbers of sites are distributed in the population, and that it does not indicate directly the mean number of "sites" available. This conclusion is illustrated by calculated exchange distributions for a number of hypothetical populations having cells in the different site categories distributed in a known manner. It follows from this conclusion that: 1. (1) different types of aberration may have different mean numbers of "sites", but the same distribution parameter; 2. (2) a Poissonian distribution of aberrations does not necessarily indicate that the mean number of "sites" per cell is unlimited or even large. {\textcopyright} 1966.},

@article{Doggett1983,
abstract = {The chromosome aberration yield for human lymphocytes exposed in vitro to various doses of 137Cesium has been studied. Dicentric, total acentric, and excess acentric data were seen to follow a Possion distribution. Calculated total hits demonstrated over-dispersion which could possibly be accounted for by a greater occurrence of single-hit phenomena being repaired than two-hit exchange processes. The resulting distribution generally contained an under-representation of cells with odd numbers of hits and an over-representation of zero- and even-hit classes as compared with Poisson predicted values. The relationship between dicentric yield and dose received in rads was fitted to the linear-quadratic formula Y = alpha D + beta D2 for dicentrics, yielding values of (20.1 +/- 3.8) X 10(-4) (aberrations/cell)/rad and (1.89 +/- 0.75) X 10(-6) (aberrations/cell)/rad2 for alpha and beta respectively. A plot of percent 'normal' cells versus the dose in rads resembled cell survival curves and was fitted to the relation P(D) = 100 e-Y where Y = alpha D + beta D2 with alpha = (23 +/- 11) X 10(-4) rad-1 and beta = (8.3 +/- 2.5) X 10(-6) rad-2. A possible use of scoring 'normal' cells for purposes of biological dosimetry is presented.},

abstract = {The Bayesian framework has been shown to be very useful in cytogenetic dose estimation. This approach allows description of the probability of an event in terms of previous knowledge, e.g. its expectation and/or its uncertainty. A new R package entitled radir (radiation inverse regression) has been implemented with the aim of reproducing a recent Bayesian-type dose estimation methodology. radir adopts the method of dose estimation under the Poisson assumption of the responses (the chromosomal aberrations counts) for the required dose-response curve (typically linear or quadratic). The individual commands are described in detail and relevant examples of the use of the methods and the corresponding radir software tools are given. The suitability of this methodology is highlighted and its application encouraged by providing a user-friendly command-type software interface within the R statistical software (version 3.1.1 or higher), which includes a complete manual.},

abstract = {Consideration of statistical methodology is essential for the application of cytogenetic and other biodosimetry techniques to triage for mass casualty situations. This is because the requirement for speed and accuracy in biodosimetric triage necessarily introduces greater uncertainties than would be acceptable in day-to-day biodosimetry. Additionally, in a large scale accident type situation, it is expected that a large number of laboratories from around the world will assist and it is likely that each laboratory will use one or more different dosimetry techniques. Thus issues arise regarding combination of results and the associated errors. In this article we discuss the statistical and computational aspects of radiation biodosimetry for triage in a large scale accident-type situation. The current status of statistical analysis techniques is reviewed and suggestions are made for improvements to these methods which will allow first responders to estimate doses quickly and reliably for suspected exposed persons.},

abstract = {Cytogenetic analysis of chromosome damage in blood lymphocytes is widely used for radiation biodosimetry. Mathematical and statistical analysis is extremely important for accurate assessment of the data and results, and there are a number of classical statistical methods which are routinely employed. However, the large number of different mathematical techniques, the dependence of the models on certain statistical principles, and the complexity of some of the methods can lead to errors in data analysis and thus misinterpretation of results. Cytogenetic dose estimation software has been developed to address these problems by simplifying mathematical and statistical analysis of the cytogenetic data. "Dose Estimate" is a collection of mathematical and statistical methods based on the cytogenetic methods that are used for biodosimetry at the Health Protection Agency and elsewhere in the radiation cytogenetics community. Details of the biological and mathematical tools incorporated into the software are presented. Preliminary testing has been carried out, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of the software in its current form. Proposals for improving the software through implementation of recently published Bayesian analysis techniques for cytogenetics are also outlined. An evaluation copy of the software is available on request from the authors.},

However, several authors have suggested that a Bayesian approach to uncertainty estimation may be more suitable for cytogenetic data, which are inherently stochastic in nature. The Bayesian analysis framework focuses on identification of probability distributions (for yield of aberrations or estimated dose), which also means that uncertainty is an intrinsic part of the analysis, rather than an 'afterthought'. In this paper Bayesian, as well as some more advanced classical, data analysis methods for radiation cytogenetics are reviewed that have been proposed in the literature. A practical overview of Bayesian cytogenetic dose estimation is also presented, with worked examples from the literature.},

abstract = {Chromosome arm lengths are the critical parameters of the human genome. The physical length is required to scale radiation hybrid and other maps to megabases. The genetic lengths in males and females are required for probabilities of exclusion and synteny, choice of well-spaced loci for linkage tests, and comparison with centromeric maps based on nondisjunction. Interpolation of new data into a map is possible only when the length is known, including the distances from centromere and telomeres to the nearest markers. Current evidence on physical parameters includes reliable measurements of relative lengths from flow cytometry but only a crude estimate of genome size (3200 megabases). Evidence on genetic parameters includes chiasma counts and linkage maps corrected for failure to sample telomeres, giving an autosomal size of 2809 centimorgans in males and 4782 centimorgans in females. Estimates of the physical and sex-specific genetic lengths are presented for each chromosome arm. Any linkage analysis that yields substantially larger estimates raises a suspicion of an inappropriate mapping function or typing errors.},

abstract = {The development of the cytokinesis-block (CB) technique has made the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay (MN) a reliable and precise method for assessing chromosome damage. Recent studies in our laboratory have confirmed that this method is a sensitive indicator of in vivo radiation exposure in patients undergoing fractionated partial-body radiotherapy and rodents exposed to uniform whole-body irradiation, thus supporting the application of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for biological dosimetry. To further define the use of this assay in biomonitoring, we have also undertaken extensive studies to determine the spontaneous level of MN in normal human populations and its relationship to various lifestyle factors. During the past year, we have also developed a new variation to the CBMN assay that enables the conversion of excision-repairable lesions to MN within one cell-cycle using cytosine arabinoside. With this method the slope of the in vitro dose-response curves was increased by a factor of 1.8 for X-rays, 10.3 for ultraviolet (254 nm) radiation, and approximately 40-fold for methylnitrosourea. Consequently, the CBMN assay can now be used not only to measure whole chromosome loss or chromosome breaks but also excision repair events. The versatility and simplicity of the CBMN assay together with new developments in automation should enable its successful application in monitoring exposed populations as well as identifying mutagen-sensitive individuals within a population.},

The data fit well to the linear quadratic model and the yield coefficients have been compared with those obtained for acute (less than 10 min) exposure. The quadratic coefficient is dependent on irradiation time and decreases approximately as predicted by Lea and Catcheside's G-function hypothesis. The possibility of a small proportion of much longer lived breaks is discussed. For purposes of biological dosimetry it is sufficient to assume a mean time of 2 h and a single exponential function for the repair of lesions when relating the effects of brief and protracted exposure.},

abstract = {Chromosome translocations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal, healthy humans increase with age, but the effects of gender, race, and cigarette smoking on background translocation yields have not been examined systematically. Further, the shape of the relationship between age and translocation frequency (TF) has not been definitively determined. We collected existing data from 16 laboratories in North America, Europe, and Asia on TFs measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes by fluorescence in situ hybridization whole chromosome painting among 1933 individuals. In Poisson regression models, age, ranging from newborns (cord blood) to 85 years, was strongly associated with TF and this relationship showed significant upward curvature at older ages versus a linear relationship (p < 0.001). Ever smokers had significantly higher TFs than non-smokers (rate ratio (RR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.30) and smoking modified the effect of age on TFs with a steeper age-related increase among ever smokers compared to non-smokers (p < 0.001). TFs did not differ by gender. Interpreting an independent effect of race was difficult owing to laboratory variation. Our study is three times larger than any pooled effort to date, confirming a suspected curvilinear relationship of TF with age. The significant effect of cigarette smoking has not been observed with previous pooled studies of TF in humans. Our data provide stable estimates of background TF by age, gender, race, and smoking status and suggest an acceleration of chromosome damage above age 60 and among those with a history of smoking cigarettes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cytogenetic dosimetry is recognized as a valuable dose assessment method which fills a gap in dosimetric technology, particularly when there are difficulties in interpreting the data, in cases where there is reason to believe that persons not wearing dosimeters have been exposed to radiation, in cases of claims for compensation for radiation injuries that are not supported by unequivocal dosimetric evidence, or in cases of exposure over an individual's working lifetime. The IAEA has maintained a long standing involvement in biological dosimetry commencing in 1978. This association has been through a sequence of coordinated research programmes (CRPs), the running of regional and national training courses, the sponsorship of individual training fellowships, and the provision of equipment to laboratories in Member States, establishing capabilities in biological dosimetry. From this has arisen the provision to Member States of advice regarding the best focus for research and suggestions for the most suitable techniques for future practice in biological dosimetry. One CRP resulted in the publication in 1986 of a manual, entitled Biological Dosimetry: Chromosomal Aberration Analysis for Dose Assessment (Technical Reports Series No. 260). This was superseded in 2001 by a revised second edition, Technical Reports Series No. 405. This present publication constitutes a third edition, with extensive updating to reflect the considerable advances that have been made in cytogenetic biological dosimetry during the past decade. The IAEA wishes to express its thanks to all authors and reviewers of this publication. The major contributions of Dr. D. Lloyd are especially acknowledged. This publication has been co-sponsored by the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization. The IAEA officer responsible for this publication was E. Buglova of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security.},

abstract = {In biological dosimetry by dicentric analysis, an exposure to radiation is considered non-homogeneous if the dicentric cell distribution shows overdispersion with respect to Poisson distribution. Traditionally, when this occurs, all non-homogeneous exposures are considered as partial-body exposures, assuming that there is only a mixture of irradiated and nonirradiated cells. The methods to estimate the dose in the irradiated fraction and the initial fraction of irradiated cells are based on separating which part of the cells without aberrations comes from the nonirradiated or irradiated fractions. In this study we show a new approach based on a mixed Poisson model, which allows for a distinction to be made between partial and heterogeneous exposures. To validate this approach blood samples from two donors, a male and a female, irradiated at different doses, were mixed at a 1:1 proportion to simulate partial and heterogeneous exposures. The results show a good agreement between the observed proportion of male and female cells and the proportion estimated by the model. Additionally, a good agreement was observed between the delivered doses, the initial fraction of cells and the ones estimated by the model. This good agreement was also observed after very high-dose irradiation (up to 17 Gy), when the lymphocyte cultures were treated with caffeine. Based on these results, we propose the use of this mixed Poisson model for a more accurate assessment of non-homogeneous exposures.},

abstract = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

The results are compared with a review of data published elsewhere. Background levels show inter-laboratory variation and possible reasons for this are discussed. By combining the present data with those from the literature the spontaneous incidence of dicentric aberrations is approx. 0.55 × 10−3 and for acentrics is 3.7 × 10−3. In occupationally exposed subjects a significantly higher incidence of aberrations was found. When allowance was made for the turnover of lymphocytes for the period over which each man had worked with radiation a linear dose-effect relationship was apparent. The incidence of dicentrics was 2.22 ± 0.94 × 10−4 rad−1 and for all unstable aberrations 8.24 ± 2.8 × 10−4 rad−1. These are in reasonable agreement with dose-response data obtained in vitro. {\textcopyright} 1980, All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Within the field of cytogenetic biodosimetry, Poisson regression is the classical approach for modeling the number of chromosome aberrations as a function of radiation dose. However, it is common to find data that exhibit overdispersion. In practice, the assumption of equidispersion may be violated due to unobserved heterogeneity in the cell population, which will render the variance of observed aberration counts larger than their mean, and/or the frequency of zero counts greater than expected for the Poisson distribution. This phenomenon is observable for both full- and partial-body exposure, but more pronounced for the latter. In this work, different methodologies for analyzing cytogenetic chromosomal aberrations datasets are compared, with special focus on zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. A score test for testing for zero inflation in Poisson regression models under the identity link is also developed.},
