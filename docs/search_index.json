Biodose Tools is an open-source project that aims to be a tool to perform all different tests and calculations needed. The app is developed with R (R Core Team 2019) together with Shiny to offer an on-line, easy-to-use solution. Although the intention is to provide the application as a website, all R routines can be downloaded for improvement or personal use. We also aim to clarify and explain the tests used and to propose those considered most appropriate. Each laboratory in its routine work should choose the optimum method, but the project aims to reach a consensus that will help us in case of mutual assistance or intercomparisons. The project is initially developed by RENEB association, but contributions are always welcome. "],
