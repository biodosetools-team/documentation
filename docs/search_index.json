Biodose Tools is an open-source project that aims to be a tool to perform all different tests and calculations needed. The app is developed with R (R Core Team 2019) together with Shiny (Chang et al. 2019) to offer an on-line, easy-to-use solution. Although the intention is to provide the application as a website, all R routines can be downloaded for improvement or personal use. We also aim to clarify and explain the tests used and to propose those considered most appropriate. Each laboratory in its routine work should choose the optimum method, but the project aims to reach a consensus that will help us in case of mutual assistance or intercomparisons. The project is initially developed by RENEB association, but contributions are always welcome.

["r-shiny-as-a-statistical-tool.html", "R Shiny as a statistical tool", " R Shiny as a statistical tool R R is a general purpose package that includes support for a wide variety of modern statistical and graphical methods (many of which have been contributed by users). It is available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The R Foundation for Statistical Computing holds and administers the copyright of the R software and documentation. R is available under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. R Shiny Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R, combining the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. Access to a powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Being in complete control of the mathematics and statistics behind. Rethink what biologists and laboratories need in their everyday workflow. Build a complete, fully documented tool. Provide an Open Source tool to the community. Modules Different modules can be built for each function (fitting, dose estimation, …) while being totally independent from one another. This opens up the possibility to implement statistical methods not included in the IAEA Manual (2011). "],

["get-offline.html", "1.2 On RStudio", " 1.2 On RStudio Many laboratories will prefer to use their own computers to run the app instead of relying on an external server, either for security reasons or better reliability. To run Biodose Tools on your local machine, you need to install R (R Core Team 2019). Additionally, we recommend to install RStudio (RStudio Team 2015). 1.2.1 Installing R 1.2.1.1 Under Windows Versions of R for Windows XP and later, including 64-bit versions, are available at CRAN. The distribution includes Rgui.exe, which launches a self-contained windowing system that includes a command-line interface, Rterm.exe for a command-line interface only, Rscript.exe for batch processing only, and R.exe, which is suitable for batch or command-line use. More information on Windows-specific issues can be found in the CRAN R for Windows FAQ. 1.2.1.2 Under macOS A version of R for macOS 10.6 and higher is available at CRAN. This is distributed as a disk image containing the installer. In addition to the graphical interface version, a command line version (particularly useful for batch operations) can be run as the command R. More information on Macintosh-specific issues can be found in the CRAN R for Mac OS X FAQ. 1.2.1.3 Under GNU/Linux R is available for most Linux distributions through your distribution’s repositories. For example, R is provided on Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu by the r-base package. Many additional packages, such as r-cran-rpart, are provided at the maintainer’s discretion. To install R on Ubuntu, run the following commands on the Terminal: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev To install R on Fedora, run the following command on the Terminal: dnf --refresh install R To install R on Arch Linux, run the following command on the Terminal: sudo pacman -S r 1.2.2 Installing RStudio RStudio for Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. RStudio requires R to be installed on the local machine, so make sure to install it first. Once installation is complete, the recommended next step for a new user would be to start RStudio and run a sample session. The &gt; character is the command prompt, and commands are executed once the user presses the RETURN or ENTER key. 1.2.3 Installing Biodose Tools The application can be easily installed by runnning install.packages(&quot;BiodoseTools&quot;) Alternatively, if you want to download the development version, you can just run devtools::install_github(&quot;biodosimetry-uab/biodose-tools-package&quot;) 1.2.4 Running Biodose Tools Once it is installed, Biodose Tools can be easily run by typing BiodoseTools::runApp() "],

["manual-ui.html", "2.1 User interface", " 2.1 User interface We describe the user interface (UI) components in this section. 2.1.1 Design principles Color is an effective, powerful and instantly recognizable medium for visual communications. In Biodose Tools color is used to identify different sections of information, a technique called color-coding. Once users are attuned to the color schemes, they can use them. Even before then, they’ll know when they’ve left one section for another, if they notice that the color scheme changed. So color-coding works to distinguish one section from another; it makes the boundaries clear. – Jenifer Tidwell (Tidwell 2010) "],
