The variety of materials and methods for making and processing lymphocyte cultures which are commonly used by laboratories around the world have been described and discussed, and probably no two laboratories adopt precisely the same technique.

This section provides a step by step description of the method followed by the [BABVE](https://www.uab.cat/departament/biologia-animal-biologia-vegetal-ecologia/) Department at UAB.

## Culturing

On receipt of a blood specimen, several replicate cultures should be set up.

### List of materials

| **List of required materials** |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| • Biosafety cabinet \(BSC\) | • Penicillin/streptomycin | • Automatic Pasteur pipette |
| • RPMI-1640 | • Sodic heparin 1% | • Serological pipette \(10 mL\) |
| • Foetal calf or human AB serum | • Permanent marker | • Micropipette \(200 µL\) |
| • Phytohemagglutinin | • Conical culture tubes \(10 mL\) | • Blue pipette tips \(1000 µL\) |
| • L-glutamine | • Test tube rack | • Waste container for used tips |

### Culture preparation

1. Prepare or defrost the tubes with the complete culture medium \(MCC\). To prepare complete culture medium from RPMI-1640 100ml:

   | **Amount** | **Component** | **Reference** |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | 100 ml | RPMI-1640 \(1x\) liquid with L-Glutamine, 25mM HEPES | GIBCO ref: 52400-017 100 ml |
   | 20 ml | Inactivated foetal calf serum | GIBCO ref: 10270-106 500 ml |
   | 5 ml | Phytohemagglutinin \(M Form\) \(PHA\), liquid | GIBCO ref: 10576-015 10 ml |
   | 2 ml | L-glutamine 200 mM \(100x\), liquid | BioWest ref: X0550-100 100 ml |
   | 1.5 ml | Penicillin/streptomycin 10,000 u/ml | BioWest ref: l0022-100 100 ml |
   | 1-1.5 ml | Sodic heparin 1% | Hospira ref: 654754.0 5 ml |

2. Make extraction of peripheral blood \(5-10 mL\) using sodium heparin anticoagulant at 1%.
3. Pass the contents of the syringe into a conical culture tube of 10 mL properly labeled with the name of the sample and the date.
4. In the BSC, drop 800 μL of sample in each tube with CCM duly labeled with the name and date.
5. Cover the tubes and homogenize them by decantation.
6. Put the tubes to incubate in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48h.

Notice that lymphocyte cultures are conventionally incubated for 48 hours, although the exact time may vary between laboratories from 46 to 52 hours. Laboratories should establish the optimum time that normally produces good yields of M1 metaphases with their routine procedure.

### Mitotic arrest
Before proceeding to the fixation procedure (2 or 3 hours), it is necessary to add 100 µl of Colcemid as an arresting agent:

| **Amount** | **Component** | **Reference** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 µl | KarioMAX Colcemid | GIBCO ref: 15212-046 |

1. Remove the cultures from the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and inside the BSC put the Colcemid. Cover the cultures and mix them by gently decantation.
2. Return the tubes to the incubator during the Colcemid time of action (2 hours or 30 minutes).
3. Turn on the bath at 37°C and put the hypotonic solution so that it is tempered.

### Fixation procedure

1. Centrifuge the tubes at 1200 rpm during 10 minutes.
2. In the BSC discard the supernatant with a glass pipette until the beginning of the conical part of the tube without touching the button.
3. Softly mix the cellular button with two plastic pipettes of hypotonic solution at 37°C using a vortex mixer. Initially, it should be drop by drop.
4. Incubate during 20 minutes at 37°C. The tubes should be completely covered by the water.
5. Centrifuge the tubes at 1200 rpm during 10 minutes.
6. Discard the supernatant with a Pasteur pipette until the beginning of the conical part of the tube without touching the button.
7. Softly mix the cellular button with fresh and cold Carnoy's solution using a vortex mixer. Initially, it should be drop by drop.
8. Centrifuge the tubes at 1200 rpm during 10 minutes.
9. Discard the supernatant by soft decanting of the tube.
10. Mix the pellet in the vortex mixer. Then fill the tube with Carnoy's solution.
11. Repeat steps 8 through 10 once more. In total 3 washings are performed.
12. Without centrifuging, the tubes are stored at 4°C until the moment of doing the extensions.

### Spreading of the chromosomes

1. Turn on a water bath or a heating iron plate with wet cellulose paper on top, at medium temperature (50-70°C).
2. Take the necessary microscope slides, kept in methanol, out of the freezer.
3. Centrifuge the sample at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes, then discard the supernatant and add a few drops of fresh Carnoy's solution until it is more or less diluted. Resuspend well with the glass Pasteur pipette.
4. Make the extensions:

	a) If we make the extensions in a bath, remove the two smaller discs from the bath lid and put a clean slide inside to moisten it.

	b) If we make the extensions on the plate, we put the slides on the wet paper to moisten it.

5. Once one sees moisture above the slide, drop 3 concentrated drops of sample from a minimum height of 4 fingers (~10 cm).
6. Take the slide, drain the excess of Carnoy's solution, then press it underneath with paper and leave it again in the bath or plate so it can be dried with warmth and humidity.
7. When the slide is completely dry, duly label the name of the sample and the technique that will be applied to the new extension.

Before dispensing all the cells from a culture onto slides, it is a good policy to place one drop of the suspension on a test slide. This enables the concentration of metaphases to be judged, and, if necessary, the remaining suspension can be further concentrated or diluted with fixative.

One should see that the nuclei are not overlapping but that many of them can be seen in the same field.

	<thead>
		<tr>
		<th colspan=3> Concentration </th>

			<td style="text-align:center"> Adequate </td>
			<td style="text-align:center"> Very concentrated </td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Additionally, both the nuclei and the metaphases should not be refringent, but they must have a semi-clear gray tone.

## Staining

The slides should be immersed in 2% (Gurr R66 improved) Giemsa stain in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer for 5 min, washed in buffer, briefly rinsed in distilled water and allowed to dry, finally mounted with a cover glass using a mounting medium. The pictures below show Giemsa-stained metaphases.

<table align="center">

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align:center"> <img src="../../assets/images/stain-dicentric.jpg" /> </td>
			<td style="text-align:center"> <img src="../../assets/images/stain-rings.jpg" /> </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align:center"> A dicentric chromosome with its accompanying acentric fragment </td>
			<td style="text-align:center"> A metaphase spread with two rings (arrowed), a dicentric and acentric fragments </td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

It is possible to modify the staining specifically to highlight centromeres although for
experienced scorers this is not normally necessary. Such highlighting can be achieved by FISH, using a pancentromeric probe or with Giemsa stain using the C-banding method.

The C-banding protocol is:

1. Place the slides in 0.2 N hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 30 min.
2. Wash three times in distilled water.
3. Place slides in 5% barium hydroxide at 60oC for 1 min.
4. Wash in 0.2 N HCl for 2 min.
5. Wash in distilled water for 2 min.
6. Place in 2x SSC at 60oC for 45 min.
7. Wash in distilled water.
8. Allow to air dry and stain in 2% Giemsa in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer for 10 min.
9. If the staining intensity is insufficient, the slides can be reimmersed in the Giemsa stain for a further 5–10 min.

## Analysis of the slides

The slides should be coded to prevent bias in the scoring and should be scanned methodically so that the entire area is covered. The scanning should be done at low magnification \(about ×100 to ×200\). At this level, it is not possible to count whether all the chromosomes are present, nor is it possible to detect aberrations. However, with practice the scorer can identify those spreads which have about 40 or more pieces and an appearance which is likely at higher magnification to be of analyzable quality. It is important that this initial scanning be done at a magnification low enough to prevent a bias towards selecting cells which contain aberrations. Having found a likely metaphase, the scorer should switch to high magnification \(about x 1000 to x 2000\), ignore, if possible, the presence of any aberrations and make a snap judgment on whether the chromosomes are of a quality suitable for scoring. This will be based on the sharpness of the images and the amount of twisting and overlapping of chromosomes. With FPG stained material the cell should be rejected if it displays the harlequin effect (as seen below), indicating that it is not an M1 spread.

![Harlequin effect](../../assets/images/harlequin-effect.jpg)

If the decision is taken to analyse the spread, then the number of individual chromosome pieces should be counted and the presence of aberrations noted. It is recommended that only complete metaphases be recorded, i.e. those with 46 centromeres. If the cell contains unstable aberrations, then it should balance. For example, a spread containing a dicentric should also have an acentric fragment, yet still count to 46 pieces. By contrast, a centric ring will also have an accompanying fragment, but the total number of objects in the cell will count to 47. Each excess acentric, i.e. one not associated with a dicentric or centric ring, will increase the count of pieces beyond 46. When recording the aberrations, the fragments associated with a dicentric or ring must not be included with the count of excess acentrics. When high radiation doses are involved there may be more than one aberration in the spread, but the pieces should still balance. Tricentric aberrations are equivalent to two dicentrics and should have two accompanying fragments, while quadricentrics will have three fragments, and so on. All abnormalities in the cell should be recorded, although for dosimetry purposes only the data on dicentrics, or dicentrics plus rings will normally be used. The x and y stage co-ordinates of all complete cells analysed, including those free from aberrations, should be recorded for possible future reference.

### Computer assisted microscopy

Metaphase finding by automated pattern recognition systems has been introduced into many labs and several commercial systems are available. These instruments also include semi-automated analysis of digitized images that assist with locating aberrant chromosomes. However, no system is fully automatic; all incorporate steps where the operator’s judgement and decision are required. Use of these instruments should be such that the same recommended criteria as outlined above are maintained, namely, selection of candidate metaphases for scoring should not introduce bias likely to distort aberration yields and only complete spreads of chromosomes should be scored.
